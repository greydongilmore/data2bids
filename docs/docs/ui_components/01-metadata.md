2. A settings panel will appear with two tabs: Json Metadata and Electrode Info.

	* **Json metadata** contains general information about the dataset.
  	  * **Lab:** what is the name of the lab collecting this data
  	  * **Experimenter:** list all individuals involved in this dataset
  	  * **Dataset Name:** overall name for the dataset.
  	  * **Institution Name/Address:** name and address of the institution at which  this dataset was collected

	<p align="center"><img src="/../docs/imgs/metadata_02.png" alt="drawing" width="80%"/></p>

	* **Electrode info** contains information about the specific electrodes used at the center:
  	  * **Manufacturer:** who produces the electrodes.
  	  * **Type:** what type of electrode is it (i.e. depth, scalp etc.)
  	  * **Material:** what material are the electrodes made from (i.e. platinum)
  	  * **Diameter:** what is the diameter of the electrode

3. Once you have modified the information click Save and the information will be stored and used for every subsequent dataset processed in the Conversion software. You will not need to re-define these values, unless they change at your site.
